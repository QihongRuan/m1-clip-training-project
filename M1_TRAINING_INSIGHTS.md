## ðŸŽ¯ **Best Practices Identified**

### M1 Optimization Guidelines
1. **Disable JIT initially** for complex models
2. **Use batch sizes 8-16** for 8GB RAM
3. **Monitor memory usage** during initial epochs
4. **Leverage all 8 cores** with proper threading

### CLIP Training Recommendations
1. **Start with smaller vocabularies** (~30-100 tokens)
2. **Use character-level tokenization** for simplicity
3. **Implement attention masking carefully** (dimension matching)
4. **Monitor both modalities** for balanced learning

### Development Workflow
1. **Test dependencies first** (NumPy, PyTorch versions)
2. **Start background training** for long processes
3. **Implement real-time monitoring** for progress tracking
4. **Save checkpoints frequently** for recovery
